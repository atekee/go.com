##### Profit Forecast with Linear Regression

Go.com is a fictional, publicly-traded eCommerce company that sells goods across three websites:
- Cars.go.com (which sells cars)
- Boats.go.com (which sells boats)
- Planes.go.com (which sells planes)
- Go.com is about to report results for its most recent quarter (1Q15)
- By collecting data from Go.com’s three websites, we’ve been able to come up with very accurate estimates for what Go.com’s reported revenue in past quarters

The attached spreadsheets contains the online sales data from Go.com’s three websites for 1Q15 as well as company reported data for the last five quarters. Each row represents YipitData's estimate for total revenue earned by a particular site for that day. If a site happened to have no sales on a particular day, there would be $0 in that row.
Based on the 1Q15 observed data and the historical data we provide, please estimate what Go.com will report as their 1Q15 profit.
